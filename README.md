# 🐱 CAT-FIGHT

I built this little project to finally answer a question that’s been on my mind while hanging out with my cat, Haitai:
If my cat were a fighting game character, what would his stats be??

This tool takes the idea and runs with it. Just upload a video of a cat (or multiple!), and it uses computer vision to identify each cat and create a unique Super Smash Bros.–style fighter profile.

You’ll get their attack power, defense, a special move, and even a signature catchphrase they’d shout before battle.

*Dog person? No worries — a new edition is coming soon!*
