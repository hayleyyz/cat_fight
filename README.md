# üê± CAT-FIGHT

This is a little project is about a question I had in my head about my cat, Haitai: if he were a fighting game character.

This tool takes the idea and flows. With a video of a cat (or multiple!), it identifies each cat and create a fighter profile, including the power, defense, a special move, and a catchphrase!
